<h1>Hot Chicken Takeover VS. KFC</h1>
<h5>Melissa Whittington December 4, 2018</h5>
<p>KFC and Hot Chicken Takeover are both restaurants that are known for their specialty, fried chicken. KFC dwarfs Hot Chicken Takeover
in that it is a global company having over 20K locations worldwide to Hot Chicken Takeover's 3 locations in Columbus, Ohio. Hot Chicken Takeover
is too small to compete financially with KFC, however, it does compete in social responsibility. Hot Chicken Takeover also has set the
bar when it comes to their hiring policies &#40;Benchmark 1&#41;. Both KFC and Hot Chicken Takeover involve their businesses in 
charitable events and encourage both employees and the community to get involved &#40;Benchmark 2&#41;.<br/>
Both businesses believe in hard work&#59; and do what they can to encourage a healthy work environment. From their policies, it is
apparent that both businesses view their employees both instrumentally and intrinsically, however, Hot Chicken takeover puts more
emphasis on intrinsic value and KFC on instrumental value &#40;Benchmark 3&#41;.<br/>
While Hot Chicken Takeover hasn't had any apparent issues with their marketing, KFC certainly has had a few hiccups. Being a smaller
business that understands its local culture, this makes it easier to advertise appropriately without risking causing riots over underestimating
the impact that a national coupon has. KFC did manage to face and solve issues they did have to at least the majority of society's
satisfaction &#40;Benchmark 4&#41;.<br/>
Sustainability is a topic of discussion and concern for many businesses today, regardless of the motivation. Both KFC and Hot Chicken Takeover
economically and socially sustainable, however, work needs to be done for them to be environmentally sustainable. Being in the restaurant industry, and
specifically the side that involves a lot take-out, the challenge to reduce waste will be an on-going battle &#40;Benchmark 5&#41;.
