<h1>Marketing</h1>
<h5>Melissa Whittington  November 11, 2018</h5>
<h3>KFC</h3>
<p>On May 5th, 2009 KFC offered an online printable coupon for a free two-piece grilled chicken meal, thinking it would bring in 
business, just not as much as they received. They decided to advertise this coupon on Oprah, and word spread so quickly that 
locations had lines going way out the door. 4 million coupons were downloaded and swiftly overwhelm KFC locations everywhere. Some 
locations ran out of chicken, and others refused to honor the coupon. Some locations created a separate line for coupon holders, 
some said that the coupons were not valid, flat-out refused to accept them, etc. (News)  Police had to be called to break up fights 
and riots at many locations. It was a marketing disaster which KFC quickly responded to by offering people rain checks and added a
free Pepsi to the coupon for the inconvenience. “All in all, 10.5 million coupons were downloaded, equating to roughly $42 million
in free food for America. (Mastermind)” While KFC’s method of advertising a free grilled chicken meal is not unethical, their 
decision to put an ad for it on a show watched by millions of people and make the coupon valid for only two weeks of borders on 
manipulation of consumers; at the very least serious lack of judgement and planning. Recommendation would be to not a flat-out 
free meal to get the word out for a new product. It would have been better had they offered a buy one get one free with an 
expiration date thirty days later, that way people are less likely to mad rush the locations and weed out people who would only 
show up for a free meal; the coupon was intended to boost sales after all.</p>
<h3>Hot Chicken Takeover</h3>
<p>Thus far, HCT does not have any ethical dilemmas that they have caused. This could be due the fact that they are still a fairly 
new establishment which is severely focused on doing everything right. Being a smaller business, it is easier to oversee operations
and identify issues before they happen. They also typically offer deals through charitable promotions, for example, the “Dress for 
Success” program where they donated $5 for every limited edition HCT t-shirt sold also gave patrons $1 off for every subsequent 
visit (HCT). Hopefully, for HCT and their consumers, they will continue to maintain their ethical standards as they continue to 
grow.</p>
