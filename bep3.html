<h1>Ethics in the Workplace</h1>
<h5>Melissa Whittington October 21, 2018</h5>
<h3>KFC</h3>
<p>KFC’s (Yum! Brands) policies display both intrinsic and instrumental value in their employees. They recognize and award employees 
who work hard and exude the intended company values. They realize that happy employees perform better and provide better customer 
service. They at the very least do what they can to make their employees feel like they are more than a replaceable part in a machine.
The Make the Colonel Proud “award is given to employees who live and breathe the passion and commitment of the KFC U.S. brand 
character, and who do things The Hard Way – the Colonel’s way. (Yum!Brands)” This is one of the many ways in which they strive to 
create a culture that emphasizes intrinsic values.  KFC Global implemented a mindfulness curriculum providing employees with skills
 to manage stress and focus on their present lives both personally and professionally. KFC prides itself in its employee training 
 programs, which increase both instrumental and intrinsic value of their employees. These programs include Service Mastery, Chicken
 Mastery, etc. Yum! Brands holds a 3.8 rating on Glassdoor.com by employees, with a high majority both recommending working for 
 them, and a high approval rating of the CEO, Greg Creed (Glassdoor).</p>
<p>Conflicts of interest can arise between both the corporate and franchise sides of KFC. In 2009, KFC ignored franchise owner’s 
input regarding the main focus for advertising being on the grilled chicken line. Corporate wanted to branch into the healthier 
trend, which greatly ignored their main money maker, Original Recipe. The conflict of interest arises because franchises are 
required to purchase what corporate decides is on the menu, forcing franchise owners to invest in the products, and giving 
corporate additional revenues that greatly affect the small business owners. This ended up with franchise owner suing Yum! Brands 
because they lost sales over the grilled chicken campaign, causing their businesses to suffer (QSRWeb). Another conflict of 
interest that arises is their healthy diet campaigning to consumers, which can be harmful to their sales since they do not have 
healthy options at KFC. This reduces profits given to shareholders. Not campaigning for healthy diet can have a negative effect on 
consumers of their products. Sales may increase from encouraging people to eat whatever they want, but then this affects their 
customers with obesity and other health problems.</p>
<p>There were no workplace privacy complaints to be found for KFC. Employees should not use work time to be on social media, nor 
should they utilize work devices for personal matters if they do not want their privacy intruded upon by their employer. Issues 
that could arise for employees is how they represent themselves on social media. Whether or not an employee’s profile is personal 
or work related, how one acts on-line does affect both the image of the individual and the company. This is especially true for 
employees in management or higher positions. Employees in many businesses have been terminated for negative comments about their 
place of work. If one makes their place of work public on-line, it no longer is strictly a personal profile, as the public can 
construe the words and actions of an employee to be considered acceptable by the company they work for. Companies should respect 
the privacy of employee social profiles when they are kept private, but employees should be conscientious of what they say on-line
as well.</p>
<h3>Hot Chicken Takeover</h3>
<p>Hot Chicken Takeover culture is intrinsically motivated. This is not to say that they do not place instrumental value in their 
employees. They say that they value people for who they are and what they bring as individuals, but they only keep people who are 
willing to work. Intrinsic value is recognized in their hiring process. They target their hiring process towards people who have a 
hard time finding work, whether it is because they are homeless, have a criminal record, or any other situation that complicates 
the usual hiring process. Hot Chicken Takeover believes everyone deserves a chance to make themselves better and to prove to 
others that they can do it. They are not a large company, and thus, do not have as much ability to offer programs to their 
employees, but they do it anyways with the specialized benefits they offer their employees. On top of having a higher than average 
starting wage, they offer pay advances because they understand that life is difficult for people sometimes and do not want their 
employees to worry about how they are going to survive until the next paycheck. The counselling they provide to employees is 
another example that they are intrinsically motivated (HCT).</p>
<p>Conflicts of interest that could arise with Hot Chicken Takeover involves balancing their responsibility to their investors and
 their mission as a business. Back in 2016, HCT took on several minority investors so that they could open more locations (Malone).
 Investors need to earn profits on their investments; being as involved in the community as Hot Chicken Takeover is does not give 
 immediate maximum profits. If they can continue to balance their philanthropy (community responsibility) and fulfill their 
 responsibility to their investors and employees, there is no issue. They have been very inventive in how they give back to the 
 community whilst also producing more revenue.</p>
<p>Hot Chicken Takeover has not thus far had any incidents involving issues with privacy. Just like with KFC, social media has a 
huge impact on business and how they are viewed. A smeared reputation for a smaller business especially can be a disaster. There 
should be some manner of professionalism is one is using social media to discuss the place they work, even if it is a personal 
account.</p>
