<h1>Sustainability</h1>
<h5>Melissa Whittington  November 15, 2018</h5>
<h3>KFC</h3>
<p>For a company as big as KFC, sustainability can quickly become an issue. At the KFC Yum! Center they have taken measures to move 
toward environmental sustainability; recycling programs, energy and water conservation plans, environmental awareness programs, etc. 
(KFCYumCenter) In particular, they are implementing principal nine of the UN Global Compact, 
whether they were aware of it or not. This appears to be more of Greenwashing at the moment; a lot of waste is produced from the 
disposable containers, straws, and plastic bags they package their food in for consumers; these measures do not extend to the 
restaurant locations necessarily either. Another issue is the amount of chickens that are consumed each year to satisfy the demand 
of consumers. KFC sales for the year 2016 was 4.48 billion dollars (Statista.com), of which the majority of those sales was fried 
chicken.</p>
<p>Considering the attention that has been brought upon KFC and other chicken food chains, one also has to consider the 
sustainability of producing the amount of chicken necessary as well as the ethical standards of chicken farmers. KFC purchases 
chickens from farms all over the world, which makes sense since it is a global company. Back in 2013, KFC halted its chicken 
supply from over one thousand farms in China due to contamination issues that marred their reputation. “Yum blamed a breakdown in 
its supply chain and said it didn't notify regulators fast enough about high levels of antiviral drugs and hormones used to 
speed-up growth in some of its poultry. (Pierson)” The farmers were not prepared for how quickly the chickens would gain weight, 
which caused some of the hens to become so obese they could not walk. “Yum said it was working to rebuild the confidence of 
Chinese consumers by improving its internal communication and relationship with suppliers (Pierson)”. With the health scandals in 
China, and the rise in competition from other companies, Yum! Brands ended its relationship with the Chinese market, essentially 
turning the Chinese KFC into an independent company.</p>
<h3>Hot Chicken Takeover</h3>
<p>Hot Chicken Takeover is a great representation of social responsibility. They help bring in funding for charities with their 
clever ways to encourage customers to participate, even if their customers’ only motivation was getting $1 off each purchase in 
the future. They provide jobs to people who normally would have an extremely difficult time to obtain one, because they believe in 
second chances. When it comes to sustainability, there is no information on the Internet to be found, which is not uncommon for 
smaller businesses. I visited HCT to get an understanding of their efforts towards sustainability; plus trying out their food was 
motivation in itself. It was apparent, like at KFC, that they produce a lot of waste for the size of their business, since all of 
their food is packaged in disposable containers regardless of it being dine-in or to-go. After contacting HCT, the information 
given was vague, but it is apparent they do recycle everything possible for them. Their reply on Messenger received was, “Moving 
toward a low waste, sustainable restaurant is something we have been working on since we opened our second restaurant in 
Clintonville. There are some limitations with our recycling providers that restrict what we are able to recycle. We've partnered 
with neighbors to find solutions.” No answer as to where they source their chicken was given. Their sustainability is basically a 
work-in-progress. Hopefully they will work as hard toward sustainability as they have for their social efforts.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>When looking at both KFC and HCT, one can observe where both are falling short on sustainability; each similarly but also in 
their own way. While KFC has a global impact, they are under the microscope to do what is ethical. HCT is praised on its focal 
points of social responsibility, while the rest does not necessarily come under scrutiny. This may have to do with how people view 
smaller companies not making a huge impact on the amount of waste created, or how they have not had any bad publicity to date. 
Considering the three pillars of sustainability, both of them are fulfilling the economic pillar with providing plenty of jobs and 
products. They both are fulfilling the social pillar, just not in the same way. KFC’s policies ensure equitable treatment, and 
they are involved in activities targeted at improving society through charity. HCT involves itself in community charity events and 
does not turn away applicants with an undesirable background, which makes them go a step further on equitable treatment than KFC 
does in that regard. HCT also has a higher starting wage than KFC. The environmental pillar is where they both fall short because 
they both make efforts to being more environmentally friendly, but still produce massive amounts of waste in respect to the sizes 
of their companies. I believe they are both working toward more ways to be environmentally sustainable, but they have a long way 
to go.</p>
