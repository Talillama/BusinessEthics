  <h2>Welcome to Crochet Creations!</h2>
  <p>Crochet, like many other arts and crafts, is a way for an individual to express themselves. Crocheting is both cathartic 
  and fun. It is an awesome feeling to put on a hat or scarf and know that you made it. Crocheting is no longer something
  your Grandma did, it is for all ages and genders wanting to feel both creative and productive. The main focus of Crochet 
  Creations is Classic style crochet and contains instructions and links to learn several different projects. Whether you are 
  a beginner or experienced in crochet, there will be something for you to learn.</p>
  <h3>What to Expect</h3>
  <p>There are several projects currently available. For the "Beginners" section, the main focus will be on learning the basics before
  creating your first project; a potholder. The "Blankets" tutorials currently focus on baby blankets. Larger sized blankets are 
  time consuming, though you can always take your knowledge of how to make a baby blanket and simply make it bigger; at least
  until larger blanket tutorials are available. The "Hats and Scarves" tutorials are great for beginners. Beanies and scarves
  are fairly quick projects, and make great gifts. There will be more complex tutorials added in the future. The "Fun Stitches"
  tutorials are easy to learn, but require an intermediate skill level. The stitches chosen are fun to do and create a nice
  embellishment to any project. As with the other tutorials, it will be expanded on in the future.
