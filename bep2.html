<h1>Culture, Leadership, and CSR</h1>
<h5>Melissa Whittington October 7, 2018</h5>
<h3>KFC</h3>
<p>KFC is owned and operated by Yum! Brands. As of 2015, Greg Creed has held the position of CEO of Yum! Brands, and thus, KFC. He 
has been with the company for over thirty years, starting as the Chief Marketing Officer of Yum! Brands in 1994 (Bloomburg.com). The 
biggest focus of  Yum! Brands has been opening new franchises, giving earning opportunities to local business owners, thus 
stimulating local economies. In a 2017 interview Creed stated, “I’ve always believed you are better served by having the customer 
experience delivered by someone who lives in the local community. (Creed)” The growth of KFC alone is eight new stores daily across 
the globe, this is a reflection of effective leadership.</p>
<p>Yum! Brands is a utilitarian based company, as their goals reflect increasing profits for shareholders, stimulating local 
economies, creating jobs, and customer satisfaction. While their main focus is profits, they do not fall under the economic CSR 
model. They have policies and standards that focus on sustainability and ethical sourcing of food and animal welfare, and a company
 culture encourages and empowers employees. They encourage employee volunteerism, participate in hunger programs, and disaster 
 relief. “The Yum! Brands Foundation supports employee volunteer efforts by funding those projects up to $5,000 and will then 
 recognize projects that made the biggest impact with even larger grants at the end of the year. (Yum!Brands)” In 2015, $325,000 
 was awarded to nonprofit grants in support of the employee volunteers and partner charities. Over 180 million pounds of food since
 1992 has been donated to more than 3,000 nonprofit organizations – valued at $860,000,000. (Yum!Brands) Considering all of these 
 aspects puts them into the philanthropic CSR model as well as ethical leadership.</p>
<h3>Hot Chicken Takeover</h3>
<p>Hot Chicken Takeover, owned by Joe DeLoss, was created out of his and his wife’s new-found love of Nashville Hot Chicken. 
Before they started their business, they wanted to create a business that would hire and give individuals who have a difficult 
time to get a job a chance, and the creation of Hot Chicken Takeover made this ideal possible. Over sixty percent of their 
workforce are ex-convicts. In an interview with 10TV, Deloss stated, “What we know is more often than not, a criminal record is 
circumstance and not character. (DeLoss)” Hot Chicken Takeover also provides benefits to their employees geared toward helping 
them succeed. They provide 2:1 Matched Milestone, cash advances, competitive wages, counseling, etc. Their success and business 
model have earned DeLoss both Entrepreneur of the Year and Social Entrepreneur of the Year in 2015.</p>
<p>Regardless of believing the best in people, hiring felons is a risk that most other businesses do not want to deal with, pairing
 that with their local community involvement makes Hot Chicken Takeover a virtue ethics-based business. They teamed up with Fusion 
 and donated $1 to Pelotonia for every Hot Fusion Takeover roll sold July 23-29, 2018. Hot Chicken Takeover has donated $5 per 
 shirt sold for Dress for Success, Kaleidoscope Youth Center, and other local non-profit organizations. HCT aided in raising over 
 40,000 meals for Food Rescue Us this past July. “We pledged to donate $1 from each meal you purchased that day to them as well. 
 (Takeover)” A lot of local businesses give back to the community, but not in the same capacity and efforts as Hot Chicken Takeover. 
 Choosing any one of the many ideals and programs they have involved themselves in would satisfy social responsibility on a 
 business for profit aspect. Because of how involved they are, they are following the philanthropic CSR model.</p>
